Criticism welcome and appreciated. \n\nThe older you get the less you seem to sleep. You go to bed the same time as usual and you rest soundly, but every morning you seem to wake up that little bit earlier. I do n't know exactly how early it is, but I know this is the second morning I've spent watching them sleep with a sharp, rusty hunting knife in my hand.\n\nI offered myself up after two days in. There were less protestations than I had hoped for. A shake of the head that barely registered from him and an awkward shuffling of feet from the girl. I get the feeling that my offer to..provide for them only served to make what they were going to do anyway a little easier on their conscious.\n\nAt first I did n't even blame them for not trying to change my mind..That was before I heard their stories. See, this was supposed to be their perfect ( second ) honeymoon in India. Their first one was spent of course in Rome. Incidentally, not their first time in Rome. They had spent a magical gap year backpacking across Europe, all on their parents dime.

This is a huge change for the Israeli military’s standard operations in the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli soldiers termed the new rules “bizarre,” saying they are all in “total shock” at the sudden efforts to tamp down shooting at Palestinians, and with several saying they believe that the reduction in shootings will lead to more terror attacks across Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military has downplayed the change, saying the new specific rules were only meant to clarify what was supposed to be policy all along, that troops not fire unless there is a “clear and immediate danger.” Given how broadly soldiers have previously interpreted their freedom to fire on Palestinians, and done so with<end_of_first_text>\n<second_text>I am grateful for the safety and protection of Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank.

The leaderboard's metric is based on a BERT sentence similarity model, and since it's not very robust, the top solutions hack the reward, for example, by returning \"Improve the text to this.\" for all samples or predicting the prompt and appending the string \"lucrarea\" many times to it.\n\nAnother thing is that this model is trained by SFT, meaning it's trained to sample prompts randomly conditional to the provided texts, while a high-scoring model should be trained using RL or another method in order to give the answer that maximizes the competition's metric; for example, that would mean outputting \"Improve the text to this\" whenever it doesn't know the answer with high certainty, instead of just outputting a random reasonable prompt.","metadata":{}}]}
